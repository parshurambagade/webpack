Webpack Study Notes
===================

Welcome to the Course
---------------------

Welcome to this course on Webpack. The instructor, Gaurav, shares over ten years of software development experience. The course covers essential tools for building frontend applications, especially in the context of single-page applications.

Course Overview
---------------

The course starts with the basics of Webpack, covering loaders, plugins, and modules. It then delves into advanced concepts like Hot Reloading, Dependency Management, and Dynamic Import. Practical implementation is demonstrated on a project. Optimization techniques and deployment strategies are also covered.

Building a React Application with Webpack
-----------------------------------------

Webpack is fundamental for building single-page applications. While the course focuses on React, the concepts are applicable to other frameworks like Angular and Vue.

Micro Frontends
---------------

Micro frontends are popular in larger companies. The course demonstrates developing an application with five coordinating micro frontends. A movie booking application is used as an example.

Understanding Webpack
---------------------

In the early days, websites loaded multiple JavaScript and CSS files separately, leading to network and maintenance issues. The CommonJS module pattern improved modularity, but required tools like Browserify to work in browsers.

Introduction to Webpack
-----------------------

Webpack simplifies the management of JavaScript modules, supporting CommonJS and ES6 modules. It optimizes performance by bundling and minimizing files, removing unused code, and preventing duplicate code loading.

Dependency Graph in Webpack
---------------------------

Webpack creates a dependency graph to understand module relationships. It starts from an entry point and traverses imports to build bundles. Unused modules are eliminated, and dependencies are bundled efficiently.

Setting up Webpack
------------------

Creating a basic project structure and configuring Webpack to bundle JavaScript files. Adding dependencies and integrating them into the project.



Webpack Basics
--------------

*   Webpack is used to bundle JavaScript files for web applications.
*   To start with Webpack, dependencies need to be installed using NPM.
*   Dependencies are managed in the package.json file.
*   Webpack configuration is specified in a webpack.config.js file.
*   Webpack can be executed using scripts defined in package.json.

Modules in JavaScript
---------------------

*   Modules are essential for organizing and managing code in JavaScript applications.
*   CommonJS and ES6 module formats are commonly used.
*   CommonJS uses require() and module.exports.
*   ES6 modules use import and export keywords.

CommonJS Modules
----------------

CommonJS modules are used in Node.js applications. They use require() to import modules and module.exports to export them.

ES6 Modules
-----------

ES6 modules are a modern approach to organizing code in JavaScript applications. They use import and export keywords.

Webpack Configuration
---------------------

Webpack configuration is defined in a webpack.config.js file. Entry points and output configurations are specified in this file.

Importing and Exporting Modules
-------------------------------

Modules can be imported and exported using commonJS or ES6 syntax. Default and named exports are supported.



ES6 Module Format Study Notes
=============================

Exporting using ES6 Module Format
---------------------------------

In ES6, to export a function or variable, use `export default` followed by the name of the function or variable.

    
            export default functionName;
        

Importing Functions
-------------------

To import functions from another file:

    
            import functionName from './filename';
        

Setting up Webpack
------------------

Webpack is used to bundle JavaScript files. Create a `webpack.config.js` file:

    
            const path = require('path');
    
            module.exports = {
                entry: './src/index.js',
                output: {
                    filename: 'bundle.js',
                    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
                },
                mode: 'development',
            };
        

Running Webpack
---------------

To run Webpack:

    
            npx webpack --config webpack.config.js --mode development
        

Named Exports
-------------

To export multiple functions or variables:

    
            export { functionName1, functionName2 };
        

Importing Named Exports
-----------------------

To import named exports:

    
            import { functionName1, functionName2 } from './filename';
        

Importing All Exports
---------------------

To import all exports as an object:

    
            import * as aliasName from './filename';
        

These notes cover the basics of ES6 module format and Webpack setup. Happy coding!

Conclusion
----------

Understanding modules and how to configure Webpack is essential for building modern JavaScript applications. By organizing code into modules and bundling them with Webpack, developers can efficiently manage complex projects.
