Webpack Dev Server Setup
========================

Introduction
------------

In this section, we'll implement a convenient feature to automate the build process and enable auto-reloading during development using Webpack Dev Server.

Installing Webpack Dev Server
-----------------------------

*   Install the Webpack Dev Server package via npm.
*   Update the webpack configuration to include a new section for development settings.
*   Define the location of files to be served by the dev server.

### Example Webpack Configuration for Dev Server:

    module.exports = {
        // Other webpack configurations
        dev: {
            static: './dist'
        }
    };

Starting the Dev Server
-----------------------

*   Add a new npm script to start the Webpack Dev Server.
*   Specify the mode as development and set the open parameter to automatically open the default browser.

### Example npm Script in package.json:

    "scripts": {
        "dev": "webpack serve --mode development --open"
    }

Testing Auto-Reloading Feature
------------------------------

*   Make changes to any file in the project.
*   Observe the automatic rebuild triggered by Webpack Dev Server.
*   Verify that the changes reflect in the browser without manual refreshing.

Conclusion
----------

Implementing Webpack Dev Server streamlines the development process by enabling automatic build and live reloading features, improving developer productivity and convenience.
