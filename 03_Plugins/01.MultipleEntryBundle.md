Webpack Plugins and Multiple Bundles
====================================

These notes covers the concepts of plugins and creating multiple bundle files using Webpack. Here are the key points:

Introduction to Plugins
-----------------------

*   Plugins are additional tools in Webpack that enhance the build process.
*   They help in automating tasks, optimizing builds, and resolving common problems.
*   Plugins automate tasks, optimize builds, and resolve common issues in the build process.
*   They provide a more efficient and streamlined development workflow.

Creating Multiple Bundle Files
------------------------------

*   When dealing with multi-page applications, each page may require its own JavaScript bundle.
*   Webpack allows defining multiple entry points to generate separate bundle files for each page.
*   Configuration changes are required in webpack.config.js to specify entry points and output file names.

### Example webpack.config.js:

    module.exports = {
        entry: {
            index: './src/index.js',
            product: './src/product.js'
        },
        output: {
            filename: '[name].bundle.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
        }
    };

Issues with Manual Bundle Creation
----------------------------------

*   Manually creating bundles and reloading the build process for each change is inefficient.
*   Errors may occur due to conflicts in file names when generating multiple bundles with the same name.


Conclusion
----------

By leveraging plugins and configuring Webpack to create multiple bundle files, developers can improve the development workflow, automate tasks, and resolve common issues efficiently.
