Webpack Font Loaders
====================

Here, we will discuss how to load fonts in a Webpack project using built-in loaders without the need for external dependencies. Here are the key points:

Downloading and Adding Fonts
----------------------------

*   Download the desired font file from a source like Google Fonts.
*   Add the font file to the project's assets folder.
*   Modify the CSS file to include the font family.

Example CSS:

    .header {
        font-family: 'Recursive', sans-serif;
    }

Applying Fonts to Elements
--------------------------

*   Select the HTML elements where the font should be applied.
*   Modify the JavaScript file to add a class to the selected elements.

Example JavaScript:

    const element = document.querySelector('.header');
    element.classList.add('style');

Configuring Webpack
-------------------

*   Add a new loader configuration in webpack.config.js to handle font files.
*   Specify supported font file types (e.g., TTF, WOFF, WOFF2).

Webpack Configuration Example:

    module.exports = {
        // other configurations
        module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test: /\.(ttf|woff|woff2)$/,
                    type: 'asset/resource'
                }
            ]
        }
    };

Conclusion
----------

By following these steps, you can efficiently load fonts in your Webpack projects using built-in loaders. No additional dependencies are required, making the process straightforward and streamlined.
