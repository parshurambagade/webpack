Webpack Loaders
=============================

Introduction to Loaders
-----------------------

Loaders are a fundamental concept in Webpack used for loading different file types such as JavaScript, images, forms, styles, HTML, and JSON into a web application.

Importance of Loaders
---------------------

Loaders are essential for integrating various file types into a single bundle in Webpack. They enable developers to handle different file types seamlessly within their projects.

Working of Loaders
------------------

1.  Webpack scans through project files and identifies the file types that need to be loaded.
    
2.  Developers define loaders in the Webpack configuration file to instruct Webpack on how to handle each file type.
    
3.  Loaders preprocess files as required (e.g., transpiling ES6 to ES5, compiling SCSS to CSS).
    
4.  The processed files are bundled together into a single output file.
    

Types of Loaders
----------------

Webpack offers various built-in loaders for different file types:

*   Babel loader for JavaScript transpilation
*   CSS loader for loading CSS files
*   File loader for loading files like images and fonts
*   JSON loader for loading JSON files
*   And many more...

Using Loaders in Webpack Configuration
--------------------------------------

Developers specify loaders in the Webpack configuration file using the `module.rules` property.

Example:

    
    module.exports = {
        module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test: /\.scss$/,
                    use: [
                        'style-loader',
                        'css-loader',
                        'sass-loader'
                    ]
                },
                {
                    test: /\.(png|jpg|gif)$/,
                    use: [
                        'file-loader'
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    };
        

Official Documentation
----------------------

Developers are encouraged to refer to the official Webpack documentation for detailed information on available loaders and their usage.
