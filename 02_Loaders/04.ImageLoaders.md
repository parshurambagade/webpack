Webpack Image Loaders
=====================

Welcome back,here we will explore loading images in Webpack using built-in loaders. Let's dive into the details:

Using Built-in Loaders for Images
---------------------------------

Webpack provides built-in loaders for handling various file types, including images. Here's how to use them:

*   Copy the project folder and create a new folder for image loaders.
*   Download an image file and add it to the project folder.
*   Configure Webpack to handle image files in webpack.config.js:
```
    module.exports = {
        // other configurations
        module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test: /\.(png|jpg|gif|svg)$/,
                    type: 'asset/resource'
                }
            ]
        }
    };
```
This configuration instructs Webpack to handle PNG, JPG, GIF, and SVG files as resources.

Importing and Using Images
--------------------------

Once configured, you can import and use images in your JavaScript files:

    import logo from './assets/pack_logo.png';
    
    const logoElement = document.getElementById('logo');
    logoElement.src = logo;

This code imports the image file and sets its source to an HTML element with the ID 'logo'.

Enhancing Build Configuration
-----------------------------

To organize generated files and clean up unused assets, you can modify Webpack's output configuration:

    module.exports = {
        // other configurations
        output: {
            filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
            clean: true,
            assetModuleFilename: 'images/[hash][ext]'
        }
    };

This configuration:

*   Sets the output filename with a content hash for cache busting.
*   Specifies the output path for generated files and enables automatic cleanup.
*   Organizes asset filenames in the 'images' folder with a hash and file extension.
